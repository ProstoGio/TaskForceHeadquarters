Taskforce Headquarters
  
  Taskforce Headquarters is the central command for high-priority operations and critical investigations. It serves as the nerve center 
where intelligence is gathered, analyzed, and acted upon with precision. Currently, the headquarters is fully engaged in the Kira case, 
coordinating every lead, monitoring suspects, and strategizing responses to unprecedented threats.
  Equipped with secure communication networks, advanced analytical tools, and expert personnel, the system ensures that every decision is informed, 
deliberate, and executed with discretion. Taskforce Headquarters is where strategy meets action, and where high-stakes operations are managed 
with absolute focus and accountability.
